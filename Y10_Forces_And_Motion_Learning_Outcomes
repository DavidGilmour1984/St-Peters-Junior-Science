const explanations = [
  "A force is a push or pull on an object, measured in newtons (N). For example, when you push a swing, you are applying a force.",
  "Forces can make objects move, stop, change speed, change direction, or change shape. For example, kicking a ball changes its speed and direction.",
  "Balanced forces cancel each other out, so there’s no change in motion. Unbalanced forces cause acceleration. For instance, if you push a box and it moves, the forces were unbalanced.",
  "Force diagrams (free body diagrams) show all the forces acting on an object with arrows. For example, a skydiver’s diagram might show gravity down and air resistance up.",
  "Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces. Rough surfaces create more friction. For example, sliding a box on carpet requires more force than on tiles.",
  "Reducing friction can make things move more easily. For example, using oil in a bike chain reduces friction and helps it turn smoothly.",
  "Mass is how much matter is in an object, measured in kilograms (kg). Weight is the force of gravity on an object, measured in newtons (N). Your mass doesn’t change on the Moon, but your weight does.",
  "Weight (W) is calculated by multiplying mass (m) by gravitational field strength (g). For example, a 10 kg object on Earth (g = 9.8 N/kg) weighs 98 N.",
  "Thrust is a forward force (like from an engine), drag opposes motion through air or water, lift acts upward (on planes), friction resists sliding, and support is the upward force from a surface.",
  "You can label forces on a diagram, like showing thrust forward, friction backward, gravity down, and support force up on a moving car.",
  "Speed is how fast something is moving. Distance is how far it goes. Time is how long it takes. For example, a car moving 100 m in 5 seconds has a speed of 20 m/s.",
  "The formula v = Δd / Δt means speed equals distance divided by time. If a bike travels 300 m in 60 seconds, speed = 300 ÷ 60 = 5 m/s.",
  "A distance-time graph shows how far something travels over time. A straight, upward line means constant speed. A flat line means stopped.",
  "Acceleration is the rate of change of speed. Use the formula a = Δv / Δt (change in velocity over time) or F = ma. If a 2 kg object accelerates at 3 m/s², the force is 6 N.",
  "Use F = ma to calculate the force needed. If a 5 kg object accelerates at 2 m/s², F = 5 × 2 = 10 N. You can rearrange the formula to find mass or acceleration too.",
  "Speed-time graphs show how speed changes. A rising line means speeding up (acceleration), a falling line means slowing down (deceleration), and a flat line means constant speed.",
  "Newton’s First Law says that if no unbalanced forces act, an object stays at rest or moves at constant speed. A ball rolling on a smooth floor will keep going unless friction or another force stops it.",
  "Newton’s Second Law links force, mass, and acceleration: F = ma. Pushing a heavier trolley requires more force to get the same acceleration.",
  "Newton’s Third Law means that for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. For example, when you jump off a boat, you push the boat backwards as you move forward.",
  "Real-world examples: First Law – a rocket coasting in space moves in a straight line until it fires engines. Second Law – a baseball accelerates faster when hit harder. Third Law – you feel a kickback when firing a gun.",
  "Terminal velocity occurs when air resistance equals weight, so acceleration stops. A skydiver speeds up until the air resistance matches their weight, then they fall at a steady speed."
